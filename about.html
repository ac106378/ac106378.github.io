        <h3>My Experience in Web Development</h3>
        <p>I don't have a ton of experience in web development, but I hope to someday do front-end web engineering as a
            career, or at least a starting point. I knew going into my last semester that I wanted to take more web
            application focused classes, so I spent the winter break some web development languages so I could be more
            prepared to dive into this course. Here's a list of the languages I spent some time studying:<br></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>HTML5</b></li>
            <li><b>CSS3</b></li>
            <li><b>JavaScript / ECMAScript 6</b></li>
        </ol>
        <p><br>I'm hoping that we'll be able to go over a lot of the best practices for using each of these languages,
            and I look forward to diving into Vue.js and building a site with it. 

            I think one more thing I would genuinely really enjoy learning in this course, is being able to leave the classroom with a good understanding of the working parts of the front end of a website. :)
