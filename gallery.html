            <p>I really enjoy Frogs. They're my favorite animal, but the passion runs deep. They're rad. I love 'em.</p>

            <p>This one is wearing snails like they're airPods. Unfortunately this doesn't come with the same
                opulence. Bummer.</p>

            <p>This is a picture that looks similar to the school i'm attending. It's by far the nicest school I've
                attended. I've only
                attended three schools, two of which were junior colleges. Even further, one was in the deep
                appalachian hills of south east Kentucky. </p>
            <p>So yeah, CSUF has been pretty nice in retrospect. I'm
                graduating from here soon so I need to take some graduation pictures. I'll probably take one like this,
                but with me in it. You can probably picture it.</p>
